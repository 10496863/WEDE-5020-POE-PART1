    <h4><b>The Brand</h4></b>
    
    Hein Scheffer, franchisor for Auto Magic identified a niche market in the auto body repair industry and began formulating a business strategy that would eventually grow to become the benchmark for non-structural repairs.
    
    Today, Auto Magic has an extensive national network of Franchisees, where the focus is on maximising opportunities with aspiring entrepreneurs wanting to be in business for themselves, but not by themselves.
    
    Concept
    Whether you have been involved in a serious car accident, a minor bumper bashing or have been the victim of any other event that has caused damage to your vehicle, having it repaired as soon as possible and to the standard you expect, is your absolute priority.
    
    At Auto Magic we understand this and have developed our repair and management systems to ensure we are market leaders in efficient repairs, carried out in the shortest possible time frame.
    
    Auto Magic offers a wide range of panel beating services that will return your vehicle to the condition it was in prior to the damage occurring, no matter what the damage.

    Each Franchisee will be required to have experienced staff, as we firmly believe your business is only as strong as your team. The Franchisee, an administrative and operational team run each outlet and staff are selected by the Franchisee, with support from the Franchisor.
    
    The discipline, with focus on quality and service required by the Franchisor must be part of the Franchisee’s business acumen, as Customer Care is part of Auto Magic’s DNA.
    
    <h4>Support</h4>
    Franchisees get classroom and on the job training. Operational support via regional staff and Head Office ensures that every branch complies with our minimum standards on quality and service.
    
   <h4> Are You Our Next Franchisee?<h4>
    We prefer owner-managed Franchises with strong operational and administrative ability. The following is an outline of the ideal profile of a franchisee:

    <h4>Commitment:</h4>
    
    The Franchisee must be willing and able to be guided by the Franchise system and be committed to work within the system.
